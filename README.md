## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer with over 30 years experience.  I used to use older version of Micrsoft Flight Simulator (up to FS9) before taking a long break from the hobby.

I was drawn back when MSFS2020 came out and have since build a small home cockpit with a mixture of home built button boxes and store bought components.

This is my first attempt at writing software to integrate with the simulator.
